The breakout board for the RFM95 (and RFM92) chip from HopeRF is not well documented. And if
you're stuck without a multimeter, like one of our local fellow [TTN
community](https://www.onisa.org.za/) members was, this can be frustrating. 

Rather than it's technical complexity, the uncertainty of not having official
documentation will be nagging your conscience. So hopefully the

[SVG](https://reuben.honigwachs.de/img/hoperf-rfm95-breakout.svg) can help.
