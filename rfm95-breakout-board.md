The breakout board for the RFM95 (and RFM92) chip from HopeRF is not well documented. And if
you're stuck without a multimeter, like one of our local fellow [TTN
community](https://www.onisa.org.za/) members was, this can be frustrating. 

Rather than it's technical complexity, it's the uncertainty of not having
official documentation which will be nagging on your conscience. So hopefully
